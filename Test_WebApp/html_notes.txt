1. 
const char saved_ok_html[] PROGMEM = R"rawliteral( 
// HTML code // 
)rawliteral";

It tells the compiler "put this information into flash memory", instead of into SRAM, where it would normally go.

2. 
Basic element in html
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading. <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
The <p> element defines a paragraph

3.
Setting The Viewport
HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag
The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

4.
The <link> element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.
The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets:
href	URL	Specifies the location of the linked document
Integrity attribute is to allow the browser to check the file source to ensure that the code is never loaded if the source has been manipulated.
Crossorigin attribute is present when a request is loaded using 'CORS' which is now a requirement of SRI checking when not loaded from the 'same-origin'.

5.
The <title> element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.


6.
The <style> element is used to define style information for a single HTML page:
rem	Relative to font-size of the root element
The margin property sets the margins for an element, 
, and is a shorthand property for the following properties:
margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left

If the margin property has two values:
margin: 10px 5px;
top and bottom margins are 10px
right and left margins are 5px

8.
The setInterval() method calls a function at specified intervals (in milliseconds).
The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to request data from a web server.

A common JavaScript syntax for using it looks much like this:

var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
       // Action to be performed when the document is read;
    }
};
xhttp.open("GET", "filename", true);
xhttp.send();

The getElementById() method is one of the most common methods in the HTML DOM. It is used almost every time you want to read or edit an HTML element.

responseText	get the response data as a string
