# IoT_Verticle_Farming

Internet of Things (IoT) is the basic for developing digital twins of verticle farming. This is the source codes for some simple examples: detect the values of light (BH1750), temperature (DHT11), and humidity (DHT11), then upload the data to a cloud platform through a microcontroller (ESP8266 NodeMCU).

Store the sensor data in a DynamoDB table, and get the data using python SDK.
